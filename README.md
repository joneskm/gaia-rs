Gears is a Rust implementation of the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). The full functionality of the
Cosmos SDK has not yet been implemented however Gears can be used to create basic Blockchains.

[This](./gaia-rs) (part) implementation of a Cosmos Hub (Gaia) node shows how Gears can be used to build a Blockchain.
